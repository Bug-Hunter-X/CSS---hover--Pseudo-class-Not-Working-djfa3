# CSS :hover Pseudo-class Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem where the CSS `:hover` pseudo-class is not working as expected for a specific element.  Other `:hover` styles are applied correctly, suggesting the issue is not a global CSS problem but rather specific to this element.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, and the `solution.css` file provides a solution.  The issue might stem from several causes, such as:

* **Z-index issues:**  Another element might be covering this element.
* **Parent element interference:**  A parent element might have `pointer-events: none;` applied.
* **JavaScript interference:**  JavaScript might be removing or altering the element's style.
* **Incorrect selector:** The CSS selector might not be correctly targeting the desired element.
* **CSS specificity:** Another, more specific, rule may be overriding the :hover rule.
